# arrayListProject [Java]
A project that simulates the rudimentary functions of a Mobile Phone. Adding, deleting, editing, searching, and printing off contacts. There are three classes in total. The main class, the Contact class, and the MobilePhone class where the bulk of the code lies. The MobilePhone class utilizes composition, because a MobilePhone "has-a" contacts list. It's there that we have the list of Contact objects as well as the functions of the phone. The main method is just our driver for bringing the code to action.

# How it works
- Clone the repository onto your local machine
- Go into the src folder and run the Main class using any IDE, or run the Main.java via the Terminal/Console.


# What I learned
I learned conceptually about the benefits of using an ArrayList over the standard Array. 
- For instance, it's flexibility and how the Arraylist is not fixed to a certain size. An arraylist's size is dynamic, not static.
- You can insert elements anywhere in an Arraylist as well as remove elements.
- The Arraylist class comes with a lot of useful methods that make it overall a superior data structure than the standard Array.
